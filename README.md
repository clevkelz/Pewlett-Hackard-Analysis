# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview

### _Purpose of the Analysis_
Pewlett Hackard has large number of employees who are nearing retirement.  These imminent departures will lead to disruption in operations unless contingency plans are put in place.  Therefore, the company has established a mentorship program to match employees who will likely retire shortly with newer employees to transfer essential knowledge.  An analysis was conducted to identify the number of upcoming retirees, who would be the group from which mentors would be identified, and the number of employees eligible for a mentorship program, who would be the group to receive the mentorship services.

### _Description of the Analysis_
The employee number and name of current employees with birth dates between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 were selected to identify employees who be the most likely to retire in the short term. The results were then sorted by title name to discern which roles have the highest number of employees nearing retirement.  The second data set was created to identify employees eligible for the mentorship program.  Employees born in 1965 can participate in this offering.
