# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview

### Purpose of the Analysis
Pewlett Hackard has large number of employees who are nearing retirement.  These imminent departures will lead to disruption in operations unless contingency plans are put in place.  Therefore, the company has established a mentorship program to match employees who will likely retire shortly with newer employees to transfer essential knowledge.  An analysis was conducted to identify the experienced employees who are eligible to participate in this program.

### Description of the Analysis
The employee number and name of current employees with birth dates between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 were selected to identify employees eligible for the mentorship program.  The results were then sorted by title name to discern which roles have the highest number of eligible employees.
